Conversation of collections\n","\n","\n","### Implicit conversions\n","\n","If we try to iterate over a collection in a `for` loop (something we'll discuss in the next chapter), Python will try to convert it into something we can browse if it knows how to do so. For example, the `dict` we saw above are not actually iterators, but Python knows how to turn them into iterators, so we can use them in an `for` loop without having to convert them ourselves.\n","\n","Sometimes the iterator we get by default may not be what we expect, if we're running through a dictionary in a `for` loop, we're running through the keys. If what we really want to do is iterate over values, or key and value pairs, we will have to specify this ourselves using the `values` and `items` functions.\n","\n","\n","### Explicit conversions\n","\n","We can convert the different types of sequences by using the `built-in` functions (corresponding to the type) to convert the sequences into the desired types:"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'canary', 'cat']\n","animals_set = set(animals)\n","print(animals_set)\n","animals_unique_list = list(animals_set)\n","print(animals_unique_list)\n","animals_unique_tuple = tuple(animals_unique_list)\n","print(animals_unique_tuple)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"VSEIscx3Zi3L","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1657025406594,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":233,"user":{"displayName":"na li","userId":"09447721022410954112"}},"outputId":"119cca1d-e9f0-4eef-eb91-164893212ace"},"execution_count":92,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'dog', 'canary', 'goldfish', 'cat'}\n","['dog', 'canary', 'goldfish', 'cat']\n","('dog', 'canary', 'goldfish', 'cat')\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["marbles = {\"red\": 34, \"green\": 30, \"brown\": 31, \"yellow\": 29 }\n","colours = list(marbles) # the keys will be used by default\n","print(colours)\n","colours1 = list(marbles.values())\n","print(colours1)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"WvzYXKhCaiFo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1657025579803,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":230,"user":{"displayName":"na li","userId":"09447721022410954112"}},"outputId":"3304e168-604b-4f47-d964-1d80d7633c5d"},"execution_count":94,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["['red', 'green', 'brown', 'yellow']\n","[34, 30, 31, 29]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":96,"metadata":{"id":"hruMcCZ9JUes","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1657025712736,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":213,"user":{"displayName":"na li","userId":"09447721022410954112"}},"outputId":"df3d478f-a83e-4086-ac6a-27a35b09768a"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{1: 2, 3: 4}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":96}],"source":["marbles = {\"red\": 34, \"green\": 30, \"brown\": 31, \"yellow\": 29 }\n","colours = list(marbles) # the keys will be used by default\n","counts = tuple(marbles.values()) # but we can use a view to get the values\n","marbles_set = set(marbles.items()) # or the key-value pairs\n","\n","\n","# Python doesn't know how to convert this into a dictionary\n","#\n","\n","# but this will work\n","dict([(1, 2), (3, 4)])"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"01_03_collections.ipynb","provenance":[],"collapsed_sections":[]},"interpreter":{"hash":"5f93c710f340a2e31cff3bb6ebdbfdc2ef47a25bab77ef50e9e25900c31fe89f"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.7"},"varInspector":{"cols":{"lenName":16,"lenType":16,"lenVar":40},"kernels_config":{"python":{"delete_cmd_postfix":"","delete_cmd_prefix":"del ","library":"var_list.py","varRefreshCmd":"print(var_dic_list())"},"r":{"delete_cmd_postfix":") ","delete_cmd_prefix":"rm(","library":"var_list.r","varRefreshCmd":"cat(var_dic_list()) "}},"types_to_exclude":["module","function","builtin_function_or_method","instance","_Feature"],"window_display":false}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
